By default the hydroxide daemon will be run by the "_hydroxide" user.
The daemon looks for credentials in:
/home/_hydroxide/.config/hydroxide

The credentials can be generated by the following command:

hydroxide auth username@protonmail.com

After the credentials are in-place, it is recommended to run the
following command:

chmod u=rw,g=,o= /home/_hydroxide/.config/hydroxide/*
