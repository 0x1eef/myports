By default hydroxide will be run as the "_hydroxide" user, and hydroxide will
look for credentials in "/home/_hydroxide/.config/hydroxide". The credentials
can be obtained by running:

hydroxide auth username@protonmail.com

The credentials will be in stored in the home directory of the user who runs
"hydroxide auth", and if run as a user other than "_hydroxide", they will
need to be copied to "/home/_hydroxide". After the credentials are in-place,
it is recommended to run:

chmod 600 /home/_hydroxide/.config/hydroxide/*
